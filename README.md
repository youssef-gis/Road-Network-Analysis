[Network Analysis of Paris's Street Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/youssef-gis/Road-Network-Analysis/blob/main/road_network_analysis.ipynb)

# 🗺️ Network Analysis of Paris's Street with Python
This project applies network analysis techniques to explore and understand the structure of Paris's road network using Python. By leveraging powerful tools like OSMnx, NetworkX, GeoPandas, and Folium, the project extracts, analyzes, and visualizes urban infrastructure to uncover hidden patterns in city design and transportation flow.

## 🔍 Key Features
Extract road network data from OpenStreetMap

Convert streets and intersections into a mathematical graph

Visualize the network structure with interactive maps

Perform shortest path analysis using Dijkstra’s algorithm

Analyze service areas and closest facility routing (e.g., nearest hospitals)

Gain insights into urban accessibility and transportation efficiency
